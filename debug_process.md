#### A record of my debugging process

- Run the code to see what output I get / whether I get any errors.
- Read errors carefully and investigate lines at which errors are reported and attempt to fix.
- If an easy fix doesn't present itself (basic typo etc.):
  - Try to understand the error and learn about it
  - Use the `p` method to get code visibility
- If I'm still having trouble or don't understand the error message even after investigating. Use google and search the error.
- If after trying these steps I can't figure it out I'll ask for advice from my cohort or a coach.
