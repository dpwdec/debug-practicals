#### A record of my debugging process

- Run the code to see what output I get / whether I get any errors
- Read errors carefully and investigate lines at which errors are reported and attempt to fix
- If an easy fix doesn't present itself (basic typo etc.):
  - Try to understand the error and learn about it
  - Use the `p` method to get code visibility
-
